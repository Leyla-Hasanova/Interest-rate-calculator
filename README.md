Interest Rate Calculator
1. What will the program do?

The program will ask the user to answer couple of questions such as loan amount, loan terms
(number of months), pay back condition (such as monthly, weekly, etc.) and interest rate.
According to these answers, it will calculate total principal amount, total interest amount and
monthly/weekly payments amount to be paid.

2. What can be given as an input?

The program prompts the user for the amount of loan, number of months, pay back condition
and interest rate.

3. What is the desired output?

The program outputs total principal amount, total interest amount, the total amount (sum of
principal and interest) to be paid and the amount of money to be paid in each payment
throughout the loan term.

4. Where will functions be used?

There will be function that returns total principal amount.
There will be function that returns total interest amount.
There will be function that returns the amount of money to be paid in each payment time.
There can be more functions if needed.

5. Where will loop (for/while) be used?

I will use the for loop while making compound interest calculation.

6. Where will if-else be used?

If-else will be used for the function that returns the amount of money to be paid in each payment
time.

7. How will the program check if the user input is correct and what will happen if it
is not?

There will be a try-except block to make sure that whether the user inserted correct notation for
repayment condition (for example, monthly – m, weekly – w).
